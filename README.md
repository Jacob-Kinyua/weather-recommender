## Running the application
To run the application in alternative two

- Open a new terminal and copy the command below:

        google-chrome index.html 
    
This enables us to run our html file in the browser.


# Project set up
Once the index.html file is running in the browser, you should be directed to a window which is displaying the weather application. In the weather application is a navigation menu containing three links.The first is the home link,that directs the user to the main page, the second is the
feedback link, that directs the user to a feedback page and the third is an about link that directs the user to a page showing what the application is about. In the main page is a location form asking the user to input a location.When the user has filled the form and submitted it, the page will display the temperature,wind speed,weather description and weather icon of the specified location.If the user wants to input another location, there is a reset location button, which when pressed, resets the location form and its results.After that, they can input a new location to receive its data.To receive a recommendation on what to wear or carry,the user will press the recommendation button that will display a recommendation with regards to the weather details given. This only works when a location has been searched up. If the user is satisfied with the application,they can press the feedback link on the navigation menu which will direct them to a feedback page that has a like button.When the like button is pressed, the colour of the heart and text in the button should change from black to blue.There is also a text area where the user can write a comment on the weather application.When the user submits the comment, they will receive an alert saying that their feedback has been received and is highly appreciated. When the user clicks on the about link on the navigation menu, they will be taken to a page that contains some information about what the application is about.That's all about the application.
